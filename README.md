Voluntary carbon credits, India's fastest and Largest Carbon Offset Program & Registry

Renewable biomass based thermal energy generation by Shiva Parvati Poultry Feed, Hingoli, Maharashtra

The project Renewable biomass based thermal energy generation by Shiva Parvati Poultry
Feed, Hingoli, Maharashtra is located at C-12, MIDC, Village: Limbala Makata, Taluka: Hingoli,
District: Hingoli, State: Maharashtra, Country: India.

Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity meets the in house demand of steam of Shiva Parvati Poultry Feed Pvt Ltd
(SPPFPT) poultry feed unit manufacturing facility and involves the installation of a 12TPH
biomass (rice husk/bagasse) based boiler. The primary technology for the project activity
involves direct combustion of biomass in the boiler to generate thermal energy. During
combustion chemical energy contained in the biomass is converted into thermal energy, which is
utilized for steam/hot air generation. The boiler of 12 TPH capacity has outlet parameters of 12.5
kg/cm2  (pressure) and 180 ÂºC (temperature). The boiler was first steam tested on 26/05/2005
which is considered as the commissioning date of the project activity.

India's Fastest, Low Cost and Simple Carbon & Water Credits Protocol

UNIVERSAL CARBON REGISTRY (SINCE 11 JULY 2021) FIRST AND LARGEST VOLUNTARY CARBON REGISTRY IN INDIA

ALL CARBON AND WATER CREDITS ARE REAL, 3RD PARTY INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED, EX-POST, MEET THE POSITIVE LIST ADDITIONALITY TEST, PERMANENT, QUANTIFIED, TRACKABLE, SUPPORT CLEAN TECHNOLOGY AND INVOLVE NO BUFFERING. MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL CREDITS ARE LISTED ON A PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT REGISTRY. CHECK OUT WWW.UCARBONREGISTRY.IO

For the carbon market ecosystem to function, there must be a transparent set of requirements for climate projects who want to be registered on UCR. The requirements set out the principles and methodologies under the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Approved Methodologies. UCR principles are the same but further rely on International Standards. All climate projects must comply with the UCR Standard, the UCR Program Manual and ISO 14064-2:2019. They must further be verified by an independent third party UCR approved accredited certification body, to be eligible for registration and issuance of carbon credits. All requirements are accessible under the Documentation section.

All UCR CARBON CREDITS (CoUs) are REAL, MEASURABLE, QUANTIFIED, MEET THE POSITIVE LIST UCR ADDITIONALITY TEST, DO NO NET HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY, CONSISTENT WITH ISO 14064-2:2019
