Renewable biomass based thermal energy generation by Shiva Parvati Poultry Feed, Hingoli, Maharashtra

The project Renewable biomass based thermal energy generation by Shiva Parvati Poultry
Feed, Hingoli, Maharashtra is located at C-12, MIDC, Village: Limbala Makata, Taluka: Hingoli,
District: Hingoli, State: Maharashtra, Country: India.

Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity meets the in house demand of steam of Shiva Parvati Poultry Feed Pvt Ltd
(SPPFPT) poultry feed unit manufacturing facility and involves the installation of a 12TPH
biomass (rice husk/bagasse) based boiler. The primary technology for the project activity
involves direct combustion of biomass in the boiler to generate thermal energy. During
combustion chemical energy contained in the biomass is converted into thermal energy, which is
utilized for steam/hot air generation. The boiler of 12 TPH capacity has outlet parameters of 12.5
kg/cm2  (pressure) and 180 ÂºC (temperature). The boiler was first steam tested on 26/05/2005
which is considered as the commissioning date of the project activity.
